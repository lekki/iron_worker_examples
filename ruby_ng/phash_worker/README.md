 # PhashExampleWorker Example

 This is an example how to run C/C++ wrappers on iron.io, I picked [phash gem](https://github.com/toy/pHash),
 which is an interface to [pHash](http://pHash.org/)


 1. Be sure you've setup your Iron.io credentials, see main [README.md](https://github.com/iron-io/iron_worker_examples).
 2. Run `iron_worker upload phash_example` to upload the worker code package to IronWorker.
 3. Run `iron_worker upload PhashExample` to queue up a task.
 4. Look at [HUD](https://hud.iron.io) to view your tasks running, check logs, etc.

 Read the code in this directory to learn more about what happened.

 #This example will only work on iron.io.
